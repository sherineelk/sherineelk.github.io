      <h2 class="question underlinegreen">
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        I first paid attention to classical music playing in the background and
        how the lines being drawn in the background while the website loads.
      </p>
      <h2 class="question underlinegreen">
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </h2>
      <ul class="answer">
        <li>- Scrolling down towards the introduction of the concert hall</li>
        <li>
          - scrolling down further to advance the scenic footage of the concert
          hall
        </li>
        <li>- clicking to transition to the video segment</li>
        <li>
          - Further scrolling down through the text segment of the ‘chapter’
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="question underlinegreen">
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        It would be the small video sections where Frank Gehry was explaining
        the process behind certain sections of the building. I felt somewhat
        discouraged to leave from the video section as there was a small text
        pop informing me if I were to scroll further I would exit the videos.
      </p>
      <h2 class="question underlinegreen">
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        It would most likely be scrolling down as a lot of the site’s function
        was tied to that action, such as transitioning between each chapter or
        segment of the website, or from final product to sketch.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textformat">
      <h2 class="question right underlineblue">
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </h2>

      <p class="answer right">
        To provide a glimpse into the thought process and the effort Frank
        Gehry's teams took to design the concert hall, in a grand, refined yet
        welcoming manner.
      </p>

      <h2 class="question right underlineblue">
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h2>

      <p class="answer right">
        The choice of classic music and smooth sweeping transitions between the
        different chapters adds this feeling of refinement. Additionally The
        scenic footage at the top of the webiste showcasing the scale and
        different angles of the building communicates a sense of grandeur to the
        viewer. This is well contrasted against the building sketches, large
        blocks of colour and thick typeface which give more of a raw feeling, as
        if the viewer is given a glimpse into the workspace where the design
        process of this building took place. These two main themes are combined
        in the header of each chapter, as pictures of different sections of the
        concert hall sweeped over by the initial sketches. This also hints to
        the viewer what Gehry will be talking about next in the video section.
      </p>

      <h2 class="question right underlineblue">
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h2>

      <p class="answer right">
        The experience is most likely intended to be interacted with only once
        for a short duration of time, at most 10 minutes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="question right underlineblue">
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h2>

      <p class="answer right">
        The overall layout of the experience promotes a fast pace viewing. In
        the text section with the text placed in a zigzag-like manner, with
        pictures taking up a little over half the layout, more information would
        be hidden underneath a ‘read more’ button that links to another page.
        The videos are broken down into 4 small clips that can be skipped
        through, rather than a longer video with multiple sections.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textformat">
      <h2 class="question underlineorange">
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        The initial sketches and large blocks of color that make up the chapter
        divisions reminds me of architecture drawings on colour construction
        paper. The introduction section that involves b-roll of the concert hall
        is shot similar to a movie or documentary. The text sections are
        reminiscent of a design magazine that puts more emphasis to wards the
        picture, rather than the writing. The video section layout mimics the
        short form content seen on social media. Towards the bottom of the
        website the index is laid out similar to an art musuem's online archive.

      <h2 class="question underlineorange">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        The text section gives me the impression to skim over it as I scroll
        through it,similar to how I would act when flipping through a paper
        magazine. The video section gives me the idea that I’m supposed to swipe
        down like I’m on YouTube shorts, however this can only done through
        clicking right to go to the next clip. At the index that I felt like I
        should slowly appreciate the models and sketches provided like I’m at a
        museum.
      </p>
      <h2 class="question underlineorange">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer">
        The introduction scene and text sections did impress me and added a
        sense of ethos when interacting with the website, as if I could trust
        what i was reading. The video section did give me a sense of familiarity
        as I'm personally more used to short form content, thus the design
        explaination seemed less intimidating and easier to process. The index
        made me stop and take in the models and sketches from a more objective
        point of view, as there's less narrative force driving this section when
        compared to the others.

      <h2 class="question right underlinered">
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer right">
        The video section, while informative, feels static compared to the rest
        of the website. Having to scroll past the videos and having to reconfirm
        that I’m leaving to the next page tampers and slows down the normally
        dynamic but fun experience.
      </p>
      <h2 class="question right underlinered">
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h2>
      <p class="answer right">
        It would be scrolling down in general. The action is overall satisfying
        for a variety of reasons. For example, the subtle movements of the
        pictures as you scroll through the explanation section, and the sweeping
        transitions between the sketches or models to the fully constructed
        concert hall in all of its glory, It made me scroll up and down multiple
        times in different segments to experience the transformation again.
