    <h2 class="question">
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p class="answer">
      I first paid attention to classical music playing in the background and
      how it related to the lines being drawn in the background while the
      website loads.
    </p>
    <h2 class="question">
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h2>
    <ul class="answer">
      <li>- Scrolling down towards the introduction of the concert hall</li>
      <li>
        - scrolling down further to advance the scenic footage of the concert
        hall
      </li>
      <li>- clicking to transition to the video segment</li>
      <li>
        - Further scrolling down through the text segment of the ‘chapter’
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It would be the small video sections where Frank Gehry was explaining the
      process behind certain sections of the building. I was somewhat
      discouraged to leave from the video section as there was a small text pop
      telling me if I were to scroll further I would exit the videos
    </p>
    <h2>
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It would most likely be scrolling down as a lot of the site’s function was
      tied to that action, such as transitioning between each chapter or segment
      of the website, or from final product to sketch.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      To provide a glimpse into the thought process and the effort Frank Gehry's
      teams took to design the concert hall, in a grand, refined yet welcoming
      manner.
    </p>
    <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
    <p>
      The choice of classic music, smooth and sweeping transitions between the
      different chapters adds this feeling of refinement. The scenic footage
      showcasing the scale and different angles of the building communicates a
      sense of grandeur to the viewer. This is well contrasted against the
      building sketches, large blocks of colour and thick typeface which gives a
      glimpse into the workspace where the design process of this building took
      place. Additionally, pictures of different sections of the concert hall
      sweeped over by the initial sketches hints to the viewer what Gehry will
      be talking about next.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The experience is most likely intended to be interacted with only once for
      a short duration of time, at most 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The overall layout of the experience promotes a fast pace viewing. In the
      text section with the text placed in a zigzag manner, with pictures taking
      up a little over half the layout, more information would be hidden
      underneath a ‘read more’ button that links to another page. The videos are
      broken down into 4 small clips that can be skipped through, rather than a
      longer video with multiple sections.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The initial sketches and large blocks of color that make up the chapter
      divisions reminds me of architecture drawings on colour construction
      paper. The introduction section that involves b-roll of the concert hall
      is shot similar to how a highly produced YouTube video. The text sections
      are reminiscent of a paper magazine. The video section layout mimics the
      short form content seen on social media. Towards the bottom of the website
      the index is laid out similar to how art museums would archive artworks
      online.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The text section gives me the impression to skim over it as I scroll
      through it,similar to how I would act when browsing through a paper
      magazine. The video section gives me the idea that I’m supposed to swipe
      through it like I’m on YouTube shorts, however this is only done through
      clicking anywhere to go to the next segment. At the index that I should
      slowly take in and appreciate the models and sketches provided like I’m at
      the museum.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The introduction scene and text sections did make me feel impressed. The
      video section did give me a sense of familiarity as I personally am more
      used to short form content, thus the design being explained seems less
      intimidating and easier to process. The index encourages the reader to
      take time to slowly examine the different models on display.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The video section, while informative, feels static compared to the rest of
      the website. Having to scroll past the videos and having to reconfirm that
      I’m leaving to the next page tampers and slows down the normally dynamic
      but fun experience.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Surprisingly enough, it would be scrolling down in general. The action is
      overall satisfying for a variety of reasons. For example the subtle
      movements of the pictures as you scroll through the explanation section,
      and the sweeping transitions between the sketches or models to the fully
      constructed concert hall in all of its glory, It made me scroll up and
      down multiple times in different segments to experience the transformation
      again.
